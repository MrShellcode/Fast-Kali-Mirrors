## Repository Configuration

To configure Kali Linux repositories on your system, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal on your Kali Linux machine.

2. Edit the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file using a text editor such as `nano` or `vim`. You will need superuser privileges, so use `sudo` or become the root user if necessary. For example:

   ```bash
   $ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
   ```

3. Comment out any existing repository URLs by adding a `#` (hash) symbol at the beginning of the lines. This will prevent the system from using those repositories. For example:

   ```bash
   # deb http://old-repo-url.com/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
   # deb-src http://old-repo-url.com/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
   ```

4. Add the following lines to your `sources.list` file to configure the Kali Linux repository:

   ```bash
   deb https://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
   deb-src https://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
   ```

   These lines specify the repository URLs for the Kali Rolling release along with the main, non-free, and contrib components.

5. Save the file and exit the text editor.

6. Update the package list by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

This command will refresh the package list, ensuring that you have access to the latest software and security updates for your Kali Linux system.

**Note**: Kali Linux is a specialized distribution primarily designed for cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and ethical hackers. It should be used responsibly and legally for authorized purposes only. Unauthorized use may violate applicable laws and regulations.
